Penrose Library is excited to introduce our new KIC (Knowledge Imaging Center) walk-up scanning station.  Using the KIC scanner is as easy as making a photocopy but allows you much more flexibility.  The color scanner has a 17”X24” scan area – four times bigger than a letter sized page.  You can save scans as multiple file types including .jpg , .pdf, and even markable, searchable .pdf for study.  The KIC scanning station is environmentally friendly, just save your scans to a USB flash drive or send them to yourself via email, no paper or toner wasted!  Come to the library to see how you can research, collaborate and study digitally.  Best of all?  Scanning is absolutely free.
