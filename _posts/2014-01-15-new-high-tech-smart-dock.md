The scanner on the main floor of Penrose Library is now even more high-tech! Our nifty new Smart Dock allows you to connect your Android or iOS device via the KIC Scanner wifi network, then upload your scanned document directly to your device. And if youâ€™re using Google Docs for your document storage, the upgraded software allows you to send documents directly to your personal or Whitman accounts. Come by and check it out!
