If you need to find data to support an argument in a paper or to analyze for a project, where do you start? Our new Data Resources LibGuide suggests starting points for the social sciences, the sciences, and the humanities, and provides links to online resources that support data analysis and visualization. We also have guidance for writing Data Management Plans, and best practices for citing datasets that you use in your research. Check it out, and let us know what additional data resources would help you!
