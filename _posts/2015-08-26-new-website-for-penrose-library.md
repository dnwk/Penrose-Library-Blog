We have made many changes to the Penrose Library website over the summer! Systems and Applications Librarian Kun Lin started work on the redesign by meeting with faculty and student focus groups in the spring semester of 2015. These groups identified important features to keep, as well as new functionality to incorporate. Recommendations from this user testing inform the new site design. Key features include responsive design (the website automatically scales for tablet and mobile devices) and an integrated side navigation menu. There are also new ways to search for databases and journals. Be sure to look at the Quick Check section of the home page. You can see at a glance in real time if study rooms are available, as well as what tutors are available at the Learning Commons; find a library map; or link to your library or ILL account. We welcome your feedback on the new site design and on additional features you would like to see.

The Penrose Library website has had a number of incarnations over the years. The most recent version was in use from January of 2013 until August 2015. See what previous Penrose Library websites looked like below.
