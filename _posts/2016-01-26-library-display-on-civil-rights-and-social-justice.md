Our featured works are primarily (although not exclusively) nonfiction; all are available for check-out. We’re also featuring an electronic version of books in the display in the carousel below.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a book or film on these subjects that you would like to recommend for the display? We have a </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/whitman.edu/forms/d/1CR-xSEzBTh7njL4xSK-_pD0kx5na5vNEFnrOgp9C1dw/viewform?usp=send_form"><span style="font-weight: 400;">web form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where you can tell us about it: author, title, a brief overview of its contents, and why you think it is important. Some of these recommendations may be shared in our display along with the work itself, with your permission. If the work you recommend isn’t already in our collection, we will see if we can acquire it.</span>

We hope that in exploring these works, you will find information and ideas that contribute to future discussions and actions.

The books pictured below are part of the library display. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Click on the circles or left-click and drag to see more images. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you click on a particular title, its record in Sherlock will tell you if it is checked out or not. </span>To check out an available featured book, look for it in the display on the main floor next to the Circulation Desk.
