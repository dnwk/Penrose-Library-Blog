On Tuesday, February 9, at 8 pm, join us at Penrose Library for a reception celebrating the Spring 2016 reopening of the Learning Commons.

The Learning Commons is a drop-in peer tutoring service. Tutors from the Center fOr Writing and Speaking (COWS), the Academic Resource Center (ARC), the Student Engagement Center (SEC), and Penrose Library are available in the Library <b>Sunday through Wednesday</b> from <b>8 to 10 pm</b>. You can find them on the main floor -- go straight past the Technology Help Desk all the way to the back, and turn right. Look for the Learning Commons sign with the big red arrow to point the way.

Have questions about finding library sources for your paper? Check with the library tutor. Looking for some writing or presentation strategies for an upcoming assignment? A COWS tutor can help. Want suggestions for your cover letters or resumes? Talk with the SEC tutor. Need help with your work for a specific class? Click on the <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/academics/academic-resource-center/tutor-program/learning-commons">link</a> in the Learning Commons section on the Â <a href="https://library.whitman.edu/">Penrose Library homepage</a> to see what subjects the ARC tutor for that day will support. (These can include Biology, Calculus, General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, and Physics, among others.)

Bring your questions to the Library!
