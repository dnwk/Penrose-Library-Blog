We first offered <a href="http://ezproxy.whitman.edu:2048/login?url=http://digital.films.com/portalplaylists.aspx?cid=1637&amp;aid=7745">Films on Demand</a>, a collection of thousands of educational programs, in 2010, and have since added specialized collections for Theatre and Dance such as <a href="http://ezproxy.whitman.edu:2048/login?url=http://www.ontheboards.tv/">ontheboards.tv</a> and <a href="http://ezproxy.whitman.edu:2048/login?url=http://www.digitaltheatreplus.com">Digital Theatre Plus</a>. We added <a href="http://ezproxy.whitman.edu:2048/login?url=https://whitman.kanopystreaming.com">Kanopy</a> to our collection in August, 2015.

Kanopy extends our streaming video offerings considerably because it includes many feature films in addition to documentaries and educational videos. Collection strengths include foreign films (especially French and German), many classic titles from the Criterion Collection (including <a href="http://ezproxy.whitman.edu:2048/login?url=https://whitman.kanopystreaming.com/video/battle-algiers-0">The Battle of Algiers</a>), and a number of silent films, as well as works by independent filmmakers. There are also many, many educational titles that range from documentary films and series to recorded lectures and training videos in a wide variety of areas.

If you look for a particular film in <a href="http://sherlock.whitman.edu/">Sherlock</a>, our library catalog, and you see a result that is held in Kanopy, just click on the Kanopy Streaming Video link in the View Online tab. If you are already logged in, you will go directly to the film.

You can also access Kanopy and browse its holdings by clicking <a href="http://ezproxy.whitman.edu:2048/login?url=https://whitman.kanopystreaming.com">here</a>, or by searching for Kanopy from the <a href="https://library.whitman.edu/database-a-z/">Database A-Z page</a> (under Databases &amp; more on the <a href="http://library.whitman.edu/">Penrose Library home page</a>) or by finding the link through a <a href="https://library.whitman.edu/subject-guides/">Library Guide</a>. When you access Kanopy via these links, you will be prompted to log in with your Whitman network ID and password.

In general, our users who have tried Kanopy have found the streaming quality to be good (albeit better on-campus than off-campus). As with any library resource, if you have difficulties accessing a film, please <a href="https://library.whitman.edu/contact-a-librarian/">let us know</a>; weâ€™ll do what we can to help. Access is available via Whitman network ID and password to current faculty, staff, and students.

We hope you enjoy using Kanopy!
