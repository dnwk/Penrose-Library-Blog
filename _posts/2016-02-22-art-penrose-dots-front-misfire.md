<i>Dots Front Misfire - </i>Gina Osterloh – 3rd floor across from staff elevator

This print of a photograph captures a scene in a 2011 installation in the Sheehan Gallery. Gina Osterloh’s larger installation project was titled <i>Cut Room. </i>The installation’s accompanying photographs depict the room seen in this photo with vibrant streamers on all surfaces, and the same sculpture in the center, as well as other similar papier-mâché figures. Osterloh’s <i>Cut Room </i>installation follows her <i>Rash Room </i>and <i>Blank Attempts</i> installations in a series titled <i>Shooting Blanks</i>; the installations have shown in the United States and the Philippines. Much of Osterloh’s work explores environments saturated in vibrant colors with particular focus on textured surfaces.
