The English term “leap year” refers to the <i>bissextile year</i>, which has 366 days rather than the usual 365 in order to reconcile the tropical year (cycle of the seasons) with the calendar year. (For more history and the rest of the rules that determine a leap year, see this <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/leap_years.php">explanation from the US Naval Observatory</a>). The best-known custom associated with leap year in Great Britain, Ireland, and the United States was that during a leap year, women were allowed to propose to men. The origins of this tradition are murky. One newspaper article from 1956 attributed it to a misinterpretation of the Latin term “bissextile” as having to do with the sexes (rather than indicating when in the Roman calendar the extra day was added in the leap year). [1] However, this explanation is not widely given in discussions of leap year traditions, and it too may be based on a false etymological interpretation.

Leap year privileges could include less permanent decisions than marriage -- the principle of ladies’ choice extended to invitations to dances, parties, and other social events. In the words of a newspaper article from Vincennes, Indiana in 1868, “The ladies must not forget that this is leap year, and that the peculiar privilege of leap year continues throughout the year 1868. All the etiquette of the sexes is reversed. If ladies wish to walk or ride with gentlemen, to dance at balls or escort them home from parties, to attend concerts, or to treat them to ice creams, they have the right to ask, or rather command everything, for it is not to be supposed that a refusal in such a case is within the bounds of possibility.” [2] The <i>Vincennes Weekly Western Sun</i> had also reminded women of this custom in earlier Leap Years, noting on February 6, 1864 (and again on the 13th) that as men were scarce due to the Civil War, women should “go to WATSON'S book-store, and procure a supply of Valentines with which to lay siege to the hearts of the sterner sex.” [3]

According to a custom known in Great Britain and the United States through the 19th century, if the man of her choice refused her proposal, the woman might expect a silk gown from him as a gift to ease her disappointment at being turned down. A February, 1856 article in the <i>Provincial</i> <em>Freeman</em>, a newspaper by and for fugitive slaves who had settled in Canada, specified that the gift of a silk gown was contingent upon the woman wearing a scarlet petticoat beneath her dress when she proposed, and showing the lower hem of the petticoat to the man if he refused her. The article noted a trend in the wearing of scarlet petticoats that winter season. [4] The silk gown tradition (but not that of the scarlet petticoat) also appeared in a story by Leigh North, published in 1919. For the ten-year-old girl in that story (whose twenty-something cousin does not want to accept her proposal, for obvious reasons) the silk gown was far more attractive than the man. [5]
