Attention returning students, faculty, and staff. If you will be at another Orbis Cascade Alliance Library this summer (see <a href="https://www.orbiscascade.org/member/">list of libraries</a>), you can check out books there! Check with Access Services at Whitman (<a href="mailto:popeja@whitman.edu">Jen Pope</a> or <a href="mailto:carterja@whitman.edu">Julie Carter</a>) to find out how.
