Penrose Library welcomes everyone back to campus for the fall semester. Our hours on Monday, August 29 are 9 am to 10 pm. We open at 9 am on Tuesday, August 30, and our 24/7 schedule resumes from that point on.

We invite all community members to stop by the library and see some of the many changes to the library building that took place over the summer. The first change you will notice when you enter the library atrium is the beautiful new art installation by Jacob Hashimoto, called <em>When Nothing Ends, Nothing Remains</em>. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/newsroom/jacob-hashimoto">here</a>. The canoe that used to hang in the atrium will have a new home in Sherwood.

You may also note that the arrangement of short bookstacks has changed in the front of the library. We have moved all of the Reference materials to the space by the wall of windows, together with the current newspapers. The books in our circulating collection that used to be in front have been reunited with the rest of our holdings in languages and literatures behind the Technology desk. We have also added some shelving to the fourth floor.

All of the DVDs and videos have been consolidated on the second floor. Where the DVDs used to be on the third floor (to the right of the large display case at the top of the stairs), there are now study carrels, standing desks, and additional seating, in a space designated for quiet study.

We have also added a large new group study room on the third floor (Room 317).

The Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) has new tables and chairs, and we have new carpeting throughout the library.

Our thanks go to the Circulation staff who shifted books, to Sheehan Gallery staff, to WCTS, and to Physical Plant for all of their help throughout our many projects this summer.

We hope you enjoy our new spaces! See you soon in the library.
