Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15-October 15) recognizes and celebrates the societal and cultural contributions of Hispanic people in the United States. Read more about it and explore links to many online exhibits and collections on the Library of Congress <a href="http://hispanicheritagemonth.gov/about/">Hispanic Heritage Month webpage</a>. Listen to diverse stories by Latinos in the US at <a href="https://storycorps.org/historias/">Story Corps Historias</a>, and read about experiences of Latino veterans at the <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/voces/">VOCES oral history project</a>.

Penrose Library has a number of resources to help you celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month and research topics related to Latinos and Latinas in the United States. Our general collection supports Whitman’s courses in Spanish, Latin American Studies, and courses across the curriculum related to Latinos/Latinas in the United States and to Latin America. Two subscription databases make finding scholarly sources in these fields easier: PRISMA (<a href="http://ezproxy.whitman.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/prismanohapi?accountid=1208">Publicaciones y Revistas Sociales y Humanísticas)</a> and HAPI (<a href="http://ezproxy.whitman.edu/login?url=http://hapi.ucla.edu/">Hispanic American Periodical Index</a>). For a rich compilation of Spanish-language newspapers published in the United States from 1808 to 1980, see the <a href="http://ezproxy.whitman.edu/login?url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/?db=EANX&amp;d_collections=EANASP">Hispanic American Newspapers collection</a>. (You will need your Whitman network ID and password to log in.)

Come to Penrose Library and browse our exhibit on the short stacks at the front of the library. It contains bilingual books from our juvenile collection, a selection of literary works by Latino and Latina authors, and scholarly research on a range of topics related to Hispanic communities in the United States. All books on display may be checked out.

This event celebrating Hispanic culture in Walla Walla began before the establishment of Hispanic Heritage Month.
