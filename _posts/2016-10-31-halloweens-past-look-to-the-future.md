Looking back 100 years or so, how did Americans celebrate Halloween? Trick-or-treating was not established, although <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86061216/1916-10-27/ed-1/seq-6/">pranks</a> certainly were; decorating with jack-o-lanterns was popular, and <a href="http://ezproxy.whitman.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/wma/docview/1715401305/BA77CE71B17C4735PQ/10?accountid=1208">costumes</a> were much in demand. Both children and adults tended to celebrate with parties or masquerades.

One set of customs seems to have died out: communicating with the spirits in order to see the future, most commonly expressed as who you would marry. There were any number of “charms” that were used to indicate compatibility; some were mentioned in a <a href="http://www.robertburns.org/works/74.shtml">poem by Robert Burns</a>. For instance, two nuts would each be assigned a name. They could thrown in the fire, and their <a href="http://ezproxy.whitman.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/125004148/55EFFF2A7A94159PQ/10?accountid=1208">placement</a> as they burned would indicate if the couple would remain together or part.

Another set of charms were related to mirrors at midnight; if a young woman looked into a mirror at that hour under the right circumstances, she would see her future husband's face reflected.

“In a thousand boarding schools a thousand girls will creep down the cellar stairs holding a mirror and a candle as the hour strikes 12, looking fearfully for the reflected face which is to tell them of the future; and in more than a thousand apartment houses--where there are no cellar stairs--young women will eat an apple before a mirror and hold a candle by whose light they expect to see that same prophetic vision” -- <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1909-10-31/ed-1/seq-12/"><i>The San Francisco call.</i> (San Francisco [Calif.]), 31 Oct. 1909. <i>Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers</i>. Lib. of Congress.</a>
