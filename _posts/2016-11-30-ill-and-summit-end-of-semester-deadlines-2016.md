As the end of the semester approaches, bringing due dates for papers and projects, Penrose Library staff want to help you find and access sources that you need for your research. Please be aware of some general policies and specific end-of-semester deadlines for students.

<b>Books, DVDs, microfilm, and other tangible media (see below for articles)</b>

Interlibrary loan (ILL) for print books and media materials can take a while, especially if items are coming from far away. The Access Services Department stopped requesting out-of-country and non-regional US loan items for students as of last week due to the time constraints for shipping. They will continue to place requests for ILL items within the Pacific Northwest/California and Montana until <b>December 7</b>. If you have any rush requests, please let <a href="mailto:popeja@whitman.edu" target="_blank">Jen Pope</a> know immediately. (These ILL ordering deadlines do not apply to faculty and staff.)

For Summit items (print books and media materials), allow at least <b>five business days</b> for delivery, as usual. You may request Summit materials during finals week, but they are very unlikely to arrive before the end of the semester. Materials that arrive after the end of the semester will be held at the Circulation Desk for seven days; if they have not been picked up before the Library closes for break, they will be sent back to their home institution before the beginning of the Spring semester. You may re-order such materials in mid-January.

<b>Articles via ILL</b>

Orders for articles via ILL are placed when the library is open, regardless of the time of year. Usually the turnaround time for an article via ILL is within 48 hours, although it can take longer, depending on the journal and the providing library. Once they have arrived, electronic ILL articles remain available in your ILL account for <b>21 days</b>. After that point, the articles are removed from your account and must be requested again, so it is a good idea to download your article as soon as you receive notification that it has arrived. Do be sure to leave yourself a cushion of a couple of days when requesting ILL articles!

<b>Returning materials at the end of the semester</b>

You can check on due dates for your Penrose, Summit, and ILL materials in your Sherlock account. Before you leave campus, please return items that are due while you will be away! Seniors who have completed a thesis in the fall, please return all materials and your locker key! Seniors who are continuing work on a thesis in the spring semester should direct any questions about due dates for materials to the Circulation Desk.

<b>Winter Break Library Hours</b>

Penrose Library will close at 5 pm on Friday, December 16. It will be on a 9 am to 5 pm schedule December 17-22, and will be closed December 23-January 2. It will reopen at 9 am on Tuesday, January 3. Library staff will not be in to process any borrowing requests during that break.
