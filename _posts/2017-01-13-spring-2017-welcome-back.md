Welcome back to campus! What's been happening over the break? Well...

We've had some (more) snow! Compare and contrast with a few wintry pictures from yesteryear, held in the Whitman College and Northwest Archives collections.

To the right, this early 20th-century photo of the Whitman Campus is undated, but has been labeled with the dates 1909-1913. (Whitman College Facilities Records, Box 16e-f)

And this one to the left shows the snow in downtown Walla Walla in 1916. (Walla Walla Photograph Collection, WCMss66, Box 1, Folder 107)

Penrose Library is open 9-5 through Sunday, January 15. On Monday, January 16, we are open 9 am to 10 pm. On Tuesday, January 17, we open at 9 and are then open 24-7 to the Whitman community until Spring Break.

We look forward to seeing you soon in the library.
