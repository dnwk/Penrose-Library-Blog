You can find answers to questions about how to find or use library resources, or about library policies and library hours, on dedicated information pages and in the Penrose Library knowledge base. This collection of frequently asked questions lets you search by question, topic, or keyword. If your question is not already there, you can send it along to the librarians at Penrose Library.

To find the FAQ, click on the How do I option from the navigation menu (1) and choose the FAQ (2).

The knowledge base interface lets you enter your question in the search box or browse questions by topic. As you type your question, you will see suggested questions that you can choose from. If you choose a topic, all related questions will be displayed.
