If your spring break plans include outdoor recreation, know that on Sunday March 19, Washington State Parks offer a free day when a <a href="http://parks.state.wa.us/167/Discover-Pass-Fees">Discover Pass</a> is not required to visit a <a href="http://parks.state.wa.us/281/Parks">state park</a>, in honor of the 104th birthday of the State Parks. The subsequent two free days are Saturday, April 15 (Spring Day), and Saturday, April 22 (Earth Day).

You can also explore opportunities in <a href="http://oregonstateparks.org/">Oregon State Parks</a> , the <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/visit">National Forests</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/index.htm">National Parks</a>.
