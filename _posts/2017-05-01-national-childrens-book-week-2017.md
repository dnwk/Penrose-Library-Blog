This year, National Children’s Book Week is May 1-7. This national literacy initiative was first established in 1919, and is administered by the nonprofit foundation <a href="http://everychildareader.net/">Every Child a Reader</a>. Penrose Library has nearly 2500 books for young readers in our <a href="http://sherlock.whitman.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?frbg=&amp;rfnGrpCounter=1&amp;fn=search&amp;indx=1&amp;dscnt=0&amp;vl(1UIStartWith0)=contains&amp;scp.scps=scope:(WHITC),scope:(WHITC_L_PGENW),scope:(WHITC_L_PAVLT),scope:(WHITC_L_PASTR),scope:(WHITC_L_PARES),scope:(WHITC_L_PACA2),scope:(WHITC_L_PACA1),scope:(WHITC_L_PGNWR),scope:(BEPRESSTHESIS),scope:(E-WHITC)&amp;tb=t&amp;vid=WHITC&amp;mode=Basic&amp;fctV=Juvenile%20Collection%20-%201st%20Floor$$IWHITC&amp;ct=&amp;rfnGrp=1&amp;srt=popularity&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;fctN=facet_local3&amp;vl(944673804UI0)=any&amp;vl(freeText0)=juvenile&amp;dum=true&amp;dstmp=1493662107592&amp;fromSavedQuery=true">Juvenile Collection</a>, shelved on the First Floor across from the elevator. These range from picture books to young adult novels, and include many classics as well as recently-published works. There is a subcollection of foreign-language and dual-language books. The majority of these are in Spanish, but other languages are also represented. The Juvenile Collection originally supported Whitman College’s course offerings in Education; a dedicated endowment supports the continued purchase of award-winning children’s books at the college.
