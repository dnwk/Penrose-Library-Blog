Penrose Library and the Center for Teaching &amp; Learning are pleased to welcome Beth Bouloukos, the Senior Acquisitions Editor at <a href="https://www.leverpress.org/">Lever Press</a>, to campus on <b>Tuesday, October 17th </b>for a talk in the CTL at noon. Most recently at the SUNY Press, Beth joined the Lever Team in August. While at SUNY her acquisition focus was education, gender and sexuality studies, cultural studies, and Latin American/Iberian/Latinx studies.

Beth's presentation will help faculty understand:
<ul>
 	<li>*how to frame a project before contacting a publisher</li>
 	<li>*how to select and approach a publisher with an idea or manuscript</li>
 	<li>*the manuscript selection and editorial processes</li>
 	<li>*basic contract information</li>
 	<li>*review and revision processes</li>
 	<li>*publication options</li>
</ul>
Beth will discuss open access monograph publishing in general and Lever Press in particular. Lever Press, an imprint of the University of Michigan Press, is committed to publishing open access, digitally-native, peer-reviewed scholarly monographs and is primarily supported by Oberlin Group of Academic Libraries. Penrose Library is a charter member of Lever Press. After the presentation, Beth, Zahi Zalloua (recently appointed to the Lever Press Editorial Board), and Dalia Corkrum will be available to answer questions. Faculty members may <a href="mailto:hutchiks@whitman.edu">RSVP</a> for lunch and this presentation by Friday, 10/13.
