The <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/about/diversity/intercultural-center/lgbtqia">Office of LGBTQIA+</a> and the student group <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/student-life/student-clubs-and-organizations/prism">P.R.I.S.M.</a> have put together a <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dXDqaqlHodPO39Iyvjpa3sD7X4fTRdkNlObJtytwPXs/edit?usp=sharing">list</a> </strong>of digital media with LGBTQIA+ characters, actors, or creators<i>. </i>If you’re looking for something to watch or listen to, this can be a great way to find media with positive LGBTQIA+ representation. If you have suggestions to add to the list, you can submit them <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/dvSvgfY4wqQG0yyS2">here</a> for the Office’s consideration.

At Whitman, the library subscribes to <a href="https://www.ezproxy.whitman.edu/login?url=https://whitman.kanopystreaming.com">Kanopy</a>, where you can stream movies featured on this list as well as other films with <a href="https://whitman.kanopystreaming.com/catalog/movies/lgbtq-cinema">LGBTQIA+ characters or creators</a>.

If you are looking for more academic work relating to the LGBTQIA+ community, we subscribe to the database <a href="https://search.alexanderstreet.com/gltc">LGBT Thought and Culture</a>, which contains both primary sources (including letters, periodicals, interviews, memoirs and ephemera) concerning the the political history of LGBTQIA+ rights as well as poetry and works of fiction by LGBTQIA+ writers.

You can also search our catalog for books, articles, and other resources. Because of the often-changing language within the LGBTQIA+ community, one way to make sure you are capturing the most resources appropriate to your research and potentially covering a wider time period is to add <b>(homosexual* OR lgbt* OR queer)</b> to your searches, such as: <b>representation AND (homosexual* OR lgbt* OR queer)</b>. The asterisk captures anything that starts with the word it’s attached to, so in this case it captures homosexual, homosexuality, homosexuals, or lgbt, lgbtq, lgbtqia+, etc.

If you have any questions about the office of LGBTQIA+ or would like to be added to their mailing list, you can email Program Coordinator Vari Robinson at <a href="mailto:robinsvk@whitman.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robinsvk@whitman.edu</a>. PRISM, a group for students that are LGBTQIA+ can be contacted at <a href="mailto:glbtq@whitman.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glbtq@whitman.edu</a>. If you have any questions about library resources or want help with research, you can contact librarians <a href="https://library.whitman.edu/contact-a-librarian/">here</a>.
