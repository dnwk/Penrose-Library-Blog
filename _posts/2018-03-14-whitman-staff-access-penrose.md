All Whitman College staff have access to Penrose Library and the <a href="https://library.whitman.edu/archives/">Whitman College and Northwest Archives</a> throughout the year. Use <a href="https://sherlock.whitman.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?menuitem=0&amp;fromTop=true&amp;fromPreferences=false&amp;fromEshelf=false&amp;vid=WHITC"><b>Sherlock</b></a><b>,</b> our interface to Penrose Library collections, as well as items held in Summit libraries and many online articles in our subscription databases, to discover interesting and exciting materials!
<p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px">o   The <b>Whitman scope</b> lets you search in the half a million or so items in Penrose Library – mainly books, DVDs, and a few print journals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px">o   The <b>Summit scope </b>includes another 30 million items held by 39 member libraries in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Books ordered from Summit libraries normally arrive within a week.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px">o   The <b>Articles scope </b>provides information about individual journal articles. Many of these articles are immediately accessible in full text; if we do not have full text access to an article you need, you can order it through Interlibrary Loan (which we call <b>ILLiad</b>).</p>
With your Whitman ID, you can borrow up to <b>15 items </b>at a time. You can borrow <b>books</b> for <b>six weeks</b> and <b>DVDs and videos</b> for <b>six days</b>. Some exceptions apply, including items on course reserves and non-circulating items.  The “Quick Check” box on right side of the library home page links to <a href="https://sherlock.whitman.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/myAccountMenu.do?vid=WHITC&amp;fromLink=gotoMyAccountUI">your account</a>, where you can keep track of materials you have on loan and their due dates.  Immediate family members of Whitman employees may find information on obtaining a Whitman ID card <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/security/campus-id-card/community">here</a>, which can then be used as a Penrose library card.

Your Whitman log-in allows access to our e-books and other digital collections (including academic journals and databases) remotely or on-campus. Make sure you are logged in on the library website to gain access (you will be prompted when it is required). You can find our list of databases <a href="https://library.whitman.edu/database-a-z/">here</a>.

Staff can be in the library 24/7, with posted exceptions. The library is open from 9AM-9PM to the community. Outside those hours you will need to swipe in with your ID card to enter the library.

If you have any questions about resources, librarians have office hours from 9-5 Monday through Friday (look for the Research Help Here sign), and are available via <a href="https://library.whitman.edu/contact-a-librarian/">phone and email</a> as well.
