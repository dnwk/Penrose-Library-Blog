On the short book stacks by the library entrance, you can find a selection of materials exploring transgender history, lives, and resources. Works include academic texts, fiction, and films. More resources are available in Sherlock. Last year, the</span><a href="https://www.whitman.edu/about/diversity/intercultural-center/lgbtqia"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Office of LGBTQIA+</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the student group</span><a href="https://www.whitman.edu/student-life/student-clubs-and-organizations/prism"> <span style="font-weight: 400">P.R.I.S.M.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> put together a</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dXDqaqlHodPO39Iyvjpa3sD7X4fTRdkNlObJtytwPXs/edit?usp=sharing"> <b>list</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400">of digital media with LGBTQIA+ characters, actors, or creators</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’re looking for something to watch or listen to, this can be a great way to find media with positive LGBTQIA+ representation.

<span style="font-weight: 400">Transgender Awareness Week leads up to November 20, Transgender Day of Remembrance, which “honors the memory of those whose lives were lost in acts of anti-transgender violence” according to </span><a href="https://www.glaad.org/transweek"><span style="font-weight: 400">GLAAD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. TDOR was started in 1998 in honor of Rita Hester.
