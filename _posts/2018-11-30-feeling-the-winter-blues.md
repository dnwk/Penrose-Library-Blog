Penrose Library houses six light therapy lamps for those who feel light deprived or are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Our “happy lights” provide daytime light intensity by replicating early morning or late afternoon spring-time light levels. Lamps are available on the first, second, and third floors of the library. Please consult the instructions for proper use provided with each lamp.

<em>Lamps furnished by ASWC Savings Fund Grant.</em>
