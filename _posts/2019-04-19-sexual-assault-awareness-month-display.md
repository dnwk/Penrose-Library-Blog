<p>April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, a campaign to raise public awareness about sexual violence and educate communities on how to prevent it. On the books stacks by the library entrance you can find a range of materials relating to this topic. Please note: these materials may be re-traumatizing for some people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With guidance from Jessica Matthews, Sexual Assault Victims Advocate, we have built a display of materials recommended by her and other support practitioners. Our collections contain academic approaches to understanding assault and trauma, guidebooks and support materials, memoirs, as well as books aimed at a general audience. We have chosen to include all of these types of materials in the display because different people need different resources. Please see a library staff member if you have any questions or concerns about the materials on display.</p>
