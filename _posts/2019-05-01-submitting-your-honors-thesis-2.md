<p><strong>What we need from you by next Wednesday </strong>(feel free to submit early!)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Signed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://works.whitman.edu/DistributionLicenseStudent" target="_blank">Non-Exclusive Distribution License</a> (initialed in both the access and embargo sections by you and your advisor) - Signed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://works.whitman.edu/thesis_certificateofapproval" target="_blank">Certificate of Approval</a>, printed on archival paper </li><li>PDF/A copy of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://library.whitman.edu/thesis/#formatting" target="_blank">properly formatted thesis</a> (consider using the template!) submitted through our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://works.whitman.edu/thesissubmission" target="_blank">form</a></li><li><strong>If you have chosen open (universal) access and want a bound copy in the Allen Reading Room</strong>, a printed copy on archival paper (see below)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Reminder: </strong>The faculty code has changed regarding requirements for honors thesis submission to the library. Starting this year, you are only required to submit a digital copy of the thesis, though you will still need to turn in a physical copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://works.whitman.edu/DistributionLicenseStudent" target="_blank">Non-Exclusive Distribution License</a> and the signed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://works.whitman.edu/thesis_certificateofapproval" target="_blank">certificate of approval form</a>. The distribution license requires you to pick which level of access you are providing to your work:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Open: Worldwide distribution via the Internet, or</li><li>Limited: Local distribution only to authorized users of Whitman’s network (current faculty, staff, and students), or</li><li>Opt-out: Not available to anyone (but still deposited). This is intended for cases where the topic or the treatment of the topic are sensitive or should not be shared</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you elect to have open access to your thesis, you can choose to print your thesis to be bound and shelved in the Allen Reading Room, where it can circulated. In the past, theses with limited access and opt-out were printed and bound but kept in the archives, but we are ceasing this unsustainable practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Forms:</strong> Both the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://works.whitman.edu/DistributionLicenseStudent" target="_blank">Non-Exclusive Distribution License</a> and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://works.whitman.edu/thesis_certificateofapproval" target="_blank">Certificate of Approval</a> (2nd page of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://works.whitman.edu/honorthesistemplate" target="_blank">thesis template</a>) need to be signed by your advisor. The Submission Agreement needs to be signed by any co-authors, even if they are not getting honors. <strong>Don't forget to initial both the access section and the embargo section. </strong>The Certificate of Approval needs to be printed on <strong>archival paper</strong> (see below) and needs your information, advisors name, and correct date filled in. This is still required even if you are not printing your thesis. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Printer</strong>: The printer you should use in the library is the one marked 2nd_theses, between the front two public access computers near the WCTS desk. Your thesis should be printed <strong>one-sided</strong>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Paper</strong>: We won't be putting paper in the printer until the 7th to keep people from accidentally printing non-theses related material on it, but until then you can always go to Kathleen's office right by the printer (213) from 8-4 M-F. If you are printing at night or on the weekends, the circ desk will have paper as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>PDF/A</strong>: Your thesis needs to be saved as a PDF/A, this can be done on the computers next to the Theses printer using Acrobat. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ua2FyyybGtpQqKRgThvOPi_tpRwTL0aXnA7NdbHMTEk/edit" target="_blank">Instructions here</a></p>
