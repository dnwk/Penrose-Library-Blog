<p>Penrose Library made several changes over the summer and we want to keep you informed. You may be wondering:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Where are the board games and popular literature collections?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have moved these collections to the main (2nd) floor alcove near the films. Popular literature can be checked out for six weeks, films and board games can be borrowed for six days. We are still working on updating our floor maps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Where is the art?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Penrose got an interior paint job this summer. Art will be curated (new pieces! different locations!) and installed by the Sheehan Gallery staff.</p>

<p><strong>What’s happening with printing?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a continuing effort by WCTS to offer no cost black and white printing and reduce paper waste, GoPrint has undergone big changes. After sending your job to print from a library computer or your personal computer, you then log on to a print release station to release your print job. Watch the process in action at <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jzY6NmqaYQlKRYKBMznwLpta15hY-Nl1/view">this video</a>. You can find more information on set-up <a href="https://kb.whitman.edu/display/public/KB/GoPrint+-+On-campus+printing">here</a>. For further assistance, please contact <a href="mailto:goprint@whitman.edu">goprint@whitman.edu</a>, or the WCTS Help Desk (helpdesk@whitman.edu or x4976).</p>

<p><strong>What if I have a question that isn’t listed here?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just ask! All library staff is here to help and the circulation desk is staffed during our open hours. We also have a <a href="https://library.whitman.edu/how-do-i/">library FAQ</a> online.<br></p>
