<p> In recognition of the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the graduation of Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas (1920), we have an exciting new exhibit on the Second Floor (Main Level) in Justice Douglas’s honor. The exhibit uses materials from the Whitman College and Northwest Archives to highlight aspects of Douglas’s legal career, work on the environment, and lifelong connection to Whitman. Along with photos and textual materials documenting his work on the Supreme Court, we also have on display every book from his prolific work as a writer. It was curated by David F. Schmitz, Robert Allen Skotheim Chair of History, and Rachel Glover, Class of 2019, with the assistance of Dana Bronson, Associate Archivist, and Emily Pearson, Instructional and Research Services Librarian. The exhibit will remain up through the Fall 2020. </p>
