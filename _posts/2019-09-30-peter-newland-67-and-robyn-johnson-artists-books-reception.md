On Tuesday, Oct. 1, from 4:30 pm - 6:00 pm, Penrose Library and the Art Department will host a reception for Peter Newland '67 and Robyn Johnson. Longtime collectors of artists' books, Newland and Johnson will be donating a portion of their collection to increase the book arts holdings of the Whitman College and Northwest Archives, and establishing an endowment to support the development of the collection. The reception will be followed by an interactive open house featuring books from their collection. Faculty, staff, students, community members and kids are all welcome. We hope you can join us for this special event.
