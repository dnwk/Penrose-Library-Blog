<p>Are you writing a thesis?  Librarians are here to help! Want to make a research plan? Unsure about the difference between an annotated bibliography and a literature review? Feel like you're having a hard time figuring out sources? Need a citation management tool? We can help with all of these, and more! </p>

<p>We have office hours in the library from 9-12, 1-5 Monday through Friday. Just look for the Research Help sign to find the right office (all near the circulation desk). You can also <a href="https://library.whitman.edu/appointments/">schedule an appointment</a> with one of us if you would like. In November we will be hosting drop-in help sessions. </p>
