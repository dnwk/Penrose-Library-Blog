<p>This winter, Penrose is getting a sustainability upgrade. We appreciate your patience while work crews convert all lighting to energy-efficient LED lamps. Please watch out for ladders and work crews. During this process, lights may also be turning on and off. This changed will reduce energy consumption of the lighting system by about 50%.</p>
