<p>In collaboration with students in Library 160: Documentation and Representation in Archives, the Whitman College and Northwest Archives is creating a digital archive of the Whitman community's experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. As we move classes online, work, teach and learn from home, and practice social distancing, our normal experiences and routines have been displaced and disrupted. We hope to collect the stories, experiences, and evidence of our changed lives, both the painful and difficult, and the unexpectedly beautiful and hopeful.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can view submissions to the digital archive in <a href="https://arminda.whitman.edu/collections/whitman-college-coronavirus-stories-collection">ARMINDA</a>, our institutional repository.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>You can record your experience in whatever format is comfortable for you. Some options include:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"className":"normal-list"} -->
<ul class="normal-list"><li>Writing: letters, emails, diary-entries, blog posts, rants, etc.</li><li>Images: what is the view from where you are? Photos, screen captures of social media posts, digital art produced in reaction to the current situation</li><li>Audio files: voice memos, phone-interviews with a friend (note: make sure you have consent of all parties before recording them), music, podcast</li><li>Videos clips: short recordings of your daily life or routines; Zoom, Google Meet, or other video conference recordings (note: make sure you have consent of all parties before recording them)</li><li>Other things you can think of: be creative! What would you like to be saved now so that Whitman students in 5 or 50 years can understand the moment we are currently living through?&nbsp;</li><li>Keep in mind that we want to collect material that gives evidence of your personal experience, or that of others in the Whitman Community, not national news stories, media reports, or other types of material that are best documented elsewhere.</li></ul>
