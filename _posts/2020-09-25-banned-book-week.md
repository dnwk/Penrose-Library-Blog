<p>Banned Books Week is an annual event celebrating the freedom to read, and this year it falls on September 27th to October 3rd. Banned Books Week spotlights current and historical attempts to censor books in libraries and schools and to support the freedom to seek and to express ideas, even those some consider unorthodox or unpopular. At a time where conspiracy theories, disinformation, and censorship run rampant, it is critical for us to remain vigilant to any attempts at censorship.</p>
